<p>Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.</p>

<p><b>What is a container?</b></p>

<p>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. While containers as a concept have been around for some time, Docker, an open source project launched in 2013, helped popularize the technology. Under the hood containers run on cgroups and namespaces.</p>

<p><b>What is container runtime?</b></p>

<p>A container runtime is software that executes containers and manages container images on a node. Today, the most widely known container runtime is Docker, but there are other container runtimes in the ecosystem, such as <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt</a>, <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a>, and <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/">lxd</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dockerfile</b></p>

<p>Dockerfile is a text document which docker daemon reads to create an image, it basically consists of instructions/commands essential to building a project that are executed in order they apperar in Dockerfile. Dockerfile starts with <code>FROM</code> i.e the base image you want to use for your project for ex:
<code>FROM ubuntu:latest</code>
you can then specify the commands to be executed for ex: installing required dependencies/packages, copying some files, exposing a port ending the Dockerfile with an entrypoint or a <code>CMD</code>, i.e commands that will be executed when container is run.</p>

<p><b>Images</b></p>

<p>Images are like snapshots/blueprint for starting containers, an image is an immutable object created from a Dockerfile, you cannot modify it, you can however create a container from an image, modify the container and then create a new image out of it, you create an image with <code>docker build</code> command and you start a container by running <code>docker run</code> on an image. An image consists of multiple layers (also called intermediate images).</p>

<p><b>Registry</b></p>

<p>Registry is a central repository for Docker images, you can create a docker image for your code locally on your laptop/desktop and then push it to registry for further distribution, other developers can pull your image and use it, contribute there changes and then push it back, so basically Registry is like a Git repository for Docker images. Orchestration platforms Kubernetes/Docker Swarm will manage deployment/scaling of containers using this registry.</p>

<p><b>Basics all done!</b></p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with the basic concepts/terminologies, you should navigate further with setting up Docker CE on your machine and create your first Dockerfile.
